## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

#### Favorite apps
Discord
- Clear UI design for the amount of features
- Replying to individual messages in a group chat
- Amount of customization options available for servers

Cash App
- Simple and clear interface for inputting amount to pay someone
- No other unnecessary features to make using app difficult

Spotify
- Ability to queue songs/albums
- Automatically generated daily mixes based on activity

TikTok
- 'For you' page that shows content based on what you like
- Sending friends videos you like

#### App idea
A card game like blackjack or poker where each player only sees their own cards on their device. Someone could start a game session to be the dealer and other players nearby (within a certain range) could join to be part of the table. This could be nice to explore the different APIs offered with iOS/apple devices.
## Notes

For me setting up Xcode gave me some issues since I have a beta version of MacOS 14. I also wasn't sure what the storyboard file in step 3 was but figured it out from the pre-work Slack.
